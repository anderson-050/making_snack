# Mont Leikpya Calculator

A simple and quick web tool to calculate the exact ingredients needed for making the delicious **Mont Leikpya** (a traditional Burmese sticky rice cake). Just enter the number of snacks you want to make, and get your scaled recipe instantly!

## 🌟 The Story Behind the Recipe
This tool was created with love and respect for tradition. My dad makes and sells the delicious Mont Leikpya at the market.

When he receives large orders(sometimes 200, 300, or more),the calculation has to be perfect. Making too little means failing to fulfill the order; making too much results in surplus and loss.

This simple calculator is my way of making his preparation easier and more reliable, ensuring every batch is just right. It's also perfect for anyone who wants to try making this wonderful snack at home!
